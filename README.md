# multiples

The program allows you to choose between text analysis and calculation.

### Text Analysis

The text analysis program asks for a word, and then presents you with three options:

- Length of the word
- Amount of consonants in the word
- Amount of vowels in the word

### Calculation

The calculation program asks for a number, and then asks you what operator you would like to use (divide, add, subtract, multiply).
It then takes that operator and then number and divides itself by itself.

For example:

1 / 1 = 1
1 - 1 = 0
1 + 1 = 2
1 * 1 = 1

The program takes the number and the operator and manipulates itself by itself.
