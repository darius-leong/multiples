### Text Analysis

The text analysis program asks for a word, and then presents you with three options:

- Length of the word
- Amount of consonants in the word
- Amount of vowels in the word
- Concatenation

### Calculation

The calculation program asks for a number, and then asks you what operator you would like to use (divide (modulo), add, subtract, multiply).
It then takes that operator and then number and divides itself by itself.

For example:

1 / 1 = 1  
1 - 1 = 0  
1 + 1 = 2  
1 * 1 = 1  

The program takes the number and the operator and manipulates itself by itself.
